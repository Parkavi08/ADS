Earthquake prediction using python

The problem is to develop an earthquake prediction model using a Kaggle dataset. The objective is to explore and understand the key features of earthquake data, visualize the data on a world map for a global overview, split the data for training and testing, and build a neural network model to predict earthquake magnitudes based on the given features.
